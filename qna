2.whay do we need a DevOps?
Increased efficiency helps to speed the development process and make it less prone to error. There are ways to automate DevOps tasks. Continuous integration servers automate the process of testing code, reducing the amount of manual work required. ... As a result, testing and deployment operations speed up.

6.deffrence between ant maven
1) One major difference between Maven and ANT is that Maven requires less configuration than ANT because it works on principle of Convention over configuration and assumes reasonable default e.g. java source file in ${basedir}/src/main/java, resources on ${basedir}/src/main/resources, JUnit test cases on ${basedir}/src/test/java etc. It also creates Java class files on ${basedir}/target/classes and JAR file on ${basedir}/target directory. On the other hand ANT requires all these directories supplied as configuration, usually in ANT build file e.g. build.xml.


2) Another significant difference between Maven and ANT is dependency Management. Maven introduced concept of repository, which is a central place to store all libraries, JARs etc. Maven allows you to use central maven repository as well as local repository and automatically download dependency during build process. While ANT based project generally use ${lib} as directory to store dependencies. Changing and updating dependency is much easier in maven than ANT because you don't need to manually download dependency. Having an organization wide central repository also helps to remove redundancy across different projects.


3) Third and most important difference between Maven and ANT is that, Maven offers a consistent and common interface to build Java projects. All you need to do is download the project and run mvn install to build it. Also by knowing maven conventions and looking at pom.xml, one can easily understand where source files are and what are project dependencies.


4) Another technical difference between ANT and Maven is that ANT task doesn't have any lifecycle, you need to define targets and there dependencies. While Maven has lifecycle, which is invoked when you run commands like mvn install. Maven executes a series of steps as a result of this command to produce artifacts e.g. JAR file, which is end of life cycle.


5) Maven also enforce a standard naming convention for artifacts defined using groupId, artifactId and version. Also one more difference between ANT and Maven is that, Maven is more than just a build tool, it act as project management tool and can generate reports etc, Though I have yet to use this feature.

2.git init
The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
3.git clone

4.recover deleted file in git
    $ git checkout -- <file> You can get a list of all the deleted files in the working tree using the command below.
    $ git ls-files --deleted. ...
    $ git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file>
    $ git checkout <commit>^ -- <file>
ans
if the deletion has not been committed, the command below will restore the deleted file in the working tree.
$ git checkout -- <file>

You can get a list of all the deleted files in the working tree using the command below.
$ git ls-files --deleted


If the deletion has been committed, find the commit where it happened, then recover the file from this commit.
$ git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file>
$ git checkout <commit>^ -- <file>

In case you are looking for the path of the file to recover, the following command will display a summary of all deleted files.
$ git log --diff-filter=D --summary

8.find jenkins log file
    locate jenkins service file : /etc/default/jenkins: location for most of the Linux distributions. /etc/sysconfig/jenkins: location for RedHat/CentOS distribution.
    Open it and probably you will see : NAME=jenkins. JENKINS_LOG=/var/log/$NAME/$NAME.log. So your file /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log must be exist.

1.what is public key and private key
Private/Secret key:
1. Private key is faster compared to public key
2. Private key is symmetrical . Actually there is only one key. the other is a copy of it.
3. Private key is truly private .Should be available with only the two communicating parties.
4. The two parties must have met before at least once to share the key.

Public key:
1. Relatively slow to encrypt/decrypt
2. Asymmetrical
3. Public key can be made public. Private key is truly secret.
4. The two parties need not have met . The two may be strangers, half way around the globe.
